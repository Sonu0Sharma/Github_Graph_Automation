### 1. Working of the Script

The primary script in this project performs the following key tasks:

- **Data Processing**: [If applicable, explain any data loading, transformation, or validation.]
- **Core Functionality**: The script [describe the main operations, e.g., running a machine learning model, processing user inputs, etc.].
- **Output Generation**: [Explain what kind of output the script generates, how it is saved or displayed, etc.]

#### Example Workflow:
- **Input**: [Description of input data]
- **Process**: [Outline of key operations in order]
- **Output**: [Description of output]

The script is designed for ease of use, with parameters specified in [mention relevant configuration files if any] that make it simple to adjust without modifying the code itself.

### 2. Working of the Workflow

The **GitHub Actions workflow** (located in `.github/workflows/`) automates several key processes:

- **Continuous Integration**: On every push or pull request, the workflow:
    - Runs linting to ensure code quality and style consistency.
    - Runs unit tests to verify that all components function as expected.
  
- **Deployment/Build**: If the main branch is updated, the workflow automatically:
    - Builds the project (if needed).
    - [Deploys it to a server or specific location, if applicable].

The workflow file (`[workflow_name].yml`) is configured to check, build, and deploy the code on predefined triggers, ensuring the repository remains functional and up-to-date.

### 3. Required Files and Directories

The following files and folders are essential to the setup:

- **Main Script** (`script_name.py`): Contains the core logic.
- **Workflow File** (`.github/workflows/[workflow_name].yml`): Manages automated processes.
- **Configuration Files** (`config.json`, `.env`, etc.): [Include any file names for configurations, credentials, or other data.]
- **Tests Folder** (`tests/`): Contains test files that are run during workflow checks.
- **Documentation** (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`): Documentation files for the repository.

### 4. Setting Up the Project

Follow these steps to create this project from scratch:

1. **Initialize a Repository**:
    - Run `git init` in your project folder.
    - Create a new repository on GitHub and link it with `git remote add origin <repo-url>`.

2. **Create Necessary Files**:
    - Create the main script file (`script_name.py`) and add core functionalities.
    - Set up configuration files as required (`config.json`, `.env`).
    - Add the workflow file under `.github/workflows/`.

3. **Define the Workflow**:
    - Write the YAML file for GitHub Actions under `.github/workflows/`, specifying triggers, jobs, and steps for building, testing, and deploying.

4. **Testing**:
    - Add a `tests` folder with test scripts for unit testing.
    - Run tests locally with `pytest` (or a similar tool) to ensure functionality before pushing.

5. **Push to GitHub**:
    - Add all files, commit changes, and push to the main branch to trigger the workflow.
